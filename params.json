I am making it to learn about programming using C++ and OpenGL.\r\n\r\n###How it works\r\nOnce you have your MenuSystem created, you can use MenuSystem->AddMenu to add a menu. You can add as many menus as you want. You can then use Menu->AddItem to add items. Items can be modified at any time as needed, using functions like ->SetPosition, ->SetSize, ->SetText, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe entire UI uses only one small texture.\r\n\r\nI'm using Visual Studio 2015 to make it.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
